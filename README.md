# MY PORTFOLIO

Just a simple website I did for fun :)

It showcases some information about me and my skillset.

# HOW TO GET THE PROJECT RUNNING

It's very simple. Since it is only a HTML based website. 

Steps:
1. Download the repository.
2. Drag the 'index.html' file to your browser and drop it.
3. Press the Enter key if necessary.

If you've got Visual Studio Code installed on your computer you can open the project folder, install the Live Server plugin and run a local server.

# WHAT IS FINISHED
- The core structure of the website has been completed. Every section contains the information that is needed. 
- The styles have been implemented and the desktop version runs flawlessly. Well, maybe there's still a little bit of lag.

# WHAT IS WORK IN PROGRESS
- The mobile version of the website. I'm currently thinking of a design in order to start coding it.
- As of now the web page isn't fully responsive.
- I am also planning on implementing SASS in order to keep everything cleaner and have a better performance overall.
